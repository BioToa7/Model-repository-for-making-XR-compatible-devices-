# Model-repository-for-making-XR-compatible-devices
A repository created with the expressed purpose of sharing reference 3D models and casings of said electronics to help other people create their own XR devices

For the sake of time and and getting it out, these are the basic model files without much cleaning up for better performance, with the incomplete headset being the exception.
This description will change once more models are cleaned up and are added to the repository. This also includes documentation, BOM, and credit for where it is required. 

Also, these first models are not all the files that I have to share. it will take time to organise the other files before I can upload them here.

If you do end up using any of the models included in this repository, tag me, credit me, or at the very least let me know that you were able to make use of the models. I would love to know that what I have created has helped others in creating their own projects.
